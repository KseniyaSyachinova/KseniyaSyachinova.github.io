A programming language is a formalized language designed to describe programs and algorithms for solving problems on a computer. Programming languages are artificial. In them, syntax and semantics are strictly defined. Therefore, they do not allow free interpretation of expression, which is typical for natural language. Programming languages are divided into two main categories high-level languages and low-level languages :\nHigh-level language [high-level language] is a programming language, the means of which provide a description of the task in a visual, easily perceived form, convenient for the programmer. It does not depend on the internal machine codes of any type of computer, so programs written in high-level languages require translation into machine codes by translator or interpreter programs. High-level languages include Fortran, PL/1, Basic, Pascal, C, Ada, etc.\nA low-level language, [low-level language] is a programming language designed for a certain type of computer and reflecting its internal machine code (see also “machine language“, “machine-oriented language“ and “assembly language“ below).\nThere are also the following types of programming languages:\nAlgorithmic language is a set of symbols, conventions and rules used to unambiguously describe algorithms and is usually part of a programming language ;\nnonalgorithmic language [nonalgorithmic language] is a programming language whose texts do not contain instructions on the order of operations and serve only as source material for the synthesis of the algorithm for solving the problem;\nFormal language [formal language] is a programming language built according to the rules of some logical calculus or formal grammar [formal grammar ], which is a system of rules for constructing finite sign sequences in a given alphabet, the set of which forms a formal language;\nThe source language is the programming language in which the program is written, as opposed to the machine language in which the programs are executed by the computer. The source languages are classified into high - level and low - level languages .\nMachine ( absolute ) language, computer language [computer (machine) language] is a programming language designed to represent programs in a form that allows them to be executed by technical means;\nMachine-dependent ( machine-oriented) language, machine-dependent programming language [computer-sensitive (computer-oriented) language] is a programming language that takes into account the structure and characteristics of a computer of a certain type or a specific computer;\nMachine-independent language [machine-independent language] is a programming language, the structure and means of which are not associated with any particular computer and allow you to execute programs compiled on it on any computer equipped with translators (see below) from this language;\nSymbolic language, symbolic coding language [symbolic language] - A programming language focused on specific computers and based on encoding machine operations using a specific set of symbols;\nHybrid ( combined ) The [hibrid language] language is a programming language that also uses the means of another language;\nGraphic language [graphic language ] is a language designed for writing machine graphics programs and using them.\nBase language [base language] –\nA machine language common to the computer family;\nA programming language in a DBMS with an autonomous language .\nCommon language - A machine language common to a group of computers and external devices used by them;\nReference language [reference language ] - The language that is the basis for all its specific versions, which are variants of the adaptation of the reference language to certain conditions of use and purpose;\nAssembly language, assembler [assembler language ] is a universal programming language belonging to the category of low-level languages, the structure of which is determined by command formats, machine language data and computer architecture.

The novel was completed and published in the Danish publishing house Gyldendal under the title “Kammerater” in 1936. In 1958 it was translated into Russian.\nPlot The action takes place in Germany from March 1928 to March 1929. Three comrades — Robert Lockamp (Robbie), Otto Koester and Gottfried Lenz maintain a small car repair shop. The main character, car mechanic Robbie, met a charming girl Patricia Holman. They — people of different destinies and from different walks of life — fell in love with each other. The novel shows the development of their love against the background of the crisis of Weimar Germany.\nMain characters The main characters\nRobert Lockamp (Robbie) is the main character of the novel, he is exactly 30 years old, the action of the novel begins on his anniversary birthday (1928). The beloved of Patricia Holman (Pat). A friend of Gottfried Lenz and Otto Koester. Participant of the First World War.\nOtto Koester is one of the main characters. Also about 30 years old. During the war, he was a pilot, in the novel he was the owner of an auto repair shop in which the main characters worked. Otto is an amateur racing driver, participated in the races on the car “Karl”, on which he won several times. He is fond of boxing.\nGottfried Lenz is one of the main characters of the novel. The same age as Otto and Robert, their comrade at the front. He served in the army, traveled a lot around the world, as evidenced by his apartment with photos of various places, a suitcase covered with all kinds of postcards, stamps and other things. He worked in an auto repair shop with Kester and Locamp. A very light, positive person, the “soul” of the company. Outwardly, he stood out in the crowd with a straw-colored shock of hair. Friends called him the last, “paper” romantic.\nPatricia Holman (Pat) is the main character’s lover. The story of this love forms the basis of the plot of the work.\nMy review The work of Three Comrades is one of the most beloved novels of all readers of Remark.The book catches with its simplicity in writing and deep meaning.\nThe novel takes place in post-war Germany.Three best friends:Lenz, Kester, Locamp.They went through the whole war together and managed to preserve their former friendship.In the work, you can single out the main character - this is Robbie Lockamp, in fact, he tells the whole story.By the way, the main love line is connected with him.Careful, spoiler alert! The book very often contains passages where the main character reasons and analyzes his decisions and actions, from a psychological point of view, such a format of writing attracts the reader’s attention and makes you think about similar questions that the Locamp will ask.\nThe beautiful half, who will have to read this masterpiece, will undoubtedly like the love line, which is almost the main one in the plot.With the most vivid epithets and verbal phrases, Remark describes the feelings that lovers experience.\nIf you are wondering whether it is worth reading this work or not, in my opinion I will definitely say that everyone should read IT, especially avid lovers of Remark, you will fall in love, as I once did\n","date":1680134400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680134400,"objectID":"10596eda3c41034688e01d9535eb0805","permalink":"https://kseniyasyachinova.github.io/post/post-10/","publishdate":"2023-03-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/post-10/","section":"post","summary":"Do you like to read?

Perhaps no one would refuse to eat pancakes with honey, apples, soft cheese, condensed milk, mushrooms, meat, etc.\nWhen cooking pancakes, housewives often face problems: how to bake thin and durable pancakes, or, conversely, lush and loose. We’ll tell you a few secrets.\nWheat flour is best suited for making pancakes. But if you prefer loose pancakes, then you can use oatmeal or buckwheat flour. To avoid the appearance of lumps, add flour in small portions, stirring constantly. In order for the pancakes to turn out very tender, the flour should be sifted 2-3 times. Water is the basis for thin and durable pancakes, but pancakes made with milk are much tastier. Mix milk and water — it will turn out strong and delicious. If you bake pancakes on kefir, they will turn out lush. You will get the same effect if you make pancakes from yeast dough. It is advisable to have a separate frying pan for baking pancakes. Here are some recipes for making pancakes with milk. They will certainly be useful to you, because these pancake recipes have been tested by more than one hostess, and the ingredients are specified in exact proportions, which guarantees a wonderful, delicate taste.\nIngredients\nMilk 1 l Eggs 4 pcs.

From the figure above, it can be seen that Git is conceptually divided into 3 large areas: workspace, local warehouse and remote warehouse. There is also a temporary storage area, also called an index area. Let’s see what each area does. The key point that Git reflects is distributed version control in that it has local storage. In fact, the usual version control work is done in the local library.\nWorkspace: This is actually our working directory in the operating system. We can view the operating system’s file management commands (for example, via the ls command in Linux). Local repository: There is a hidden directory in the workspace.git. This directory and its contents are also part of the workspace, but are a local Git repository. It is used to implement version control. Remote Warehouse: A remote warehouse is a warehouse stored on a remote server, mainly for multi-user collaboration.

Easily spreading from one life support component to another, pollution affects all environmental parameters to one degree or another - anthropogenic and natural, physical and biotic. Atmospheric pollution\nBack in the early sixties, it was believed that atmospheric pollution was a local problem of large cities and industrial centers, but later it became clear that atmospheric pollutants could spread through the air over long distances, adversely affecting areas located at a considerable distance from the place of release of these substances.\nThus, atmospheric pollution is a global phenomenon, and international cooperation is needed to control it. The most common atmospheric pollutants include gases such as chlorofluorocarbons, sulfur dioxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides.\nPollution can lead to a significant decrease in the natural concentration of gases that make up the atmosphere, such as ozone in the stratosphere. In combination with hydrocarbons and compounds of the NOx group, ozone can pose a direct danger to human health, and in addition, it is one of the important components of photochemical smog.\nDust, noise, excessive heat, radiation and electromagnetic fields are all air pollution. Depletion of the ozone layer\nThe Earth’s atmosphere consists mainly of nitrogen (about 78%) and oxygen (about 21%). A small part of oxygen is in the atmosphere in the form of ozone - oxygen molecules.\nOzone is concentrated mainly in the atmosphere at an altitude of 15-20 kilometers above the earth’s surface. Despite the small amount, the role of ozone in the Earth’s biosphere is extremely large and responsible. The ozonosphere absorbs a significant part of the harsh ultraviolet radiation of the Sun, which is harmful to living organisms.\nShe is a shield of life, but a shield regulated by nature. The ozonosphere passes the longer-wavelength part of the ultraviolet radiation. This penetrating part of ultraviolet is necessary for life: it destroys pathogenic bacteria, promotes the production of vitamin D in the human body. The state of the ozone layer is extremely important, because even a slight change in the intensity of ultraviolet radiation at the earth’s surface can affect living organisms.\nCauses of thinning of the ozone layer:\nDuring the launch of space rockets, holes are literally “burned out” in the ozone layer. And contrary to the old opinion that they are immediately tightened, these holes have existed for quite a long time. Planes flying at altitudes of 12-16 km also harm the ozone layer, while those flying below 12 km, on the contrary, contribute to the formation of ozone. Release of freons into the atmosphere. The most important reason for the destruction of the ozone layer is chlorine and its hydrogen compounds. A huge amount of chlorine enters the atmosphere, primarily from the decomposition of freons. Freons are gases that do not enter into any chemical reactions near the surface of the planet. Freons boil and quickly increase their volume at room temperature, and therefore are good …","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"e8f8d235e8e7f2efd912bfe865363fc3","permalink":"https://kseniyasyachinova.github.io/project/example/","publishdate":"2019-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/example/","section":"project","summary":"Individual final project","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"Is overpopulation threatening the Earth?","type":"project"},{"authors":["Syachinova Kseniya Ivanovna"],"categories":null,"content":" Create your slides in Markdown - click the Slides button to check out the example.
