      <h2 id="theory">Theory.</h2>
<p>A programming language is a formalized language designed to describe programs and algorithms for solving problems on a computer. Programming languages are artificial. In them, syntax and semantics are strictly defined. Therefore, they do not allow free interpretation of expression, which is typical for natural language. Programming languages are divided into two main categories high-level languages and low-level languages :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>High-level language [high-level language] is a programming language, the means of which provide a description of the task in a visual, easily perceived form, convenient for the programmer. It does not depend on the internal machine codes of any type of computer, so programs written in high-level languages require translation into machine codes by translator or interpreter programs. High-level languages include Fortran, PL/1, Basic, Pascal, C, Ada, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A low-level language, [low-level language] is a programming language designed for a certain type of computer and reflecting its internal machine code (see also “machine language“, “machine-oriented language“ and “assembly language“ below).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also the following types of programming languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Algorithmic language is a set of symbols, conventions and rules used to unambiguously describe algorithms and is usually part of a programming language ;</p>
</li>
<li>

The Algol-68 version, developed by a group of specialists of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) in 1968, received the status of an international universal programming language focused on solving not only computational, but also information problems. Although Algol is practically not used at present, it served as the basis or had a significant impact on the development of more modern languages, for example, Ada, Pascal, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>BASIC [BASIC - Beginner&rsquo;s All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code] is a high-level programming language developed in 1963 - 1964 at Dartmouth College by Thomas Kurt and John Kemeny. It was originally intended for teaching programming. It is characterized by simplicity, easily assimilated by novice programmers due to the presence of simplified Fortran language constructions and built-in mathematical functions, algorithms and operators. There are many different versions of Basic that are not fully compatible with each other. Some Basic implementations include data processing tools and datasets. Most versions of Basic use an interpreter that converts its components into machine code and allows you to run programs without intermediate translation. Some more advanced versions of Basic allow the use of translators for this purpose. Microsoft&rsquo;s Quick Basic, Borland&rsquo;s Turbo Basic, and Power Basic (an improved version of Turbo Basic distributed by Spectra Publishing) are widely used on IBM PCs. At the beginning of 1999 Microsoft has released a version of Visual Basic 6.0 (VB 6.0), designed to create multicomponent software applications for enterprise-level systems. For more information about it, see [429].</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cobol [COBOL - COmmon Buisiness-Oriented Language] is a high-level programming language developed in the late 1950s by the KADASIL Association to solve commercial and economic problems. It is distinguished by advanced means of working with files. Since the commands of programs written in this language actively use the usual English vocabulary and syntax, Cobol is considered as one of the simplest programming languages. Currently it is used to solve economic, informational and other tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lisp [LISP - LISt Processing] is an algorithmic language developed in 1960 by J. McCarthy and designed to manipulate lists of data elements. It is used mainly in university laboratories in the USA to solve problems related to artificial intelligence. In Europe , they prefer to use a Prologue for work on artificial intelligence .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LOGO [LOGO from Greek logos - word ] is a high-level programming language developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in approximately 1970 for the purpose of teaching mathematical concepts.

</li>
<li>
<p>Pascal [PASCAL is an acronym from French - Program Applicque a la Selection et la Compilation Automatique de la Litterature] is a high-level procedural-oriented programming language developed in the late 1960s. By Niklaus Wirth, originally for teaching programming at universities. It is named after the 17th-century French mathematician Blaise Pascal. In its initial version, Pascal had rather limited capabilities, since it was intended for educational purposes, but its subsequent improvements made it a good universal language, widely used, including for writing large and complex programs. There are a number of versions of the language (for example, ETH Pascal, USD Pascal, Turbo Pascal) and programming systems in this language for different types of computers. For IBM PC, the most popular is the Turbo Pascal system from Borland (USA). For more information about the Pskov languages and their development, see [653].</p>
</li>
<li>

It belongs to the category of fifth-generation languages. It was developed in 1971 at the University of Marseille (France), is one of the widely used and constantly developing languages. Its latest version is Prolog 6.0. For more details, see [561].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C [C ] is a multi-purpose high-level programming language developed by Denis Ritchie in the early 1970s based on the BCPL language. It is used on minicomputers and PCs. It is the basic language of the Unix operating system, but it is also used outside of this system to write high-speed and efficient software products, including operating systems. There are a number of popular versions of the C language for IBM PC, including Turbo C (by Borland), Microsoft C and Quick C (by Microsoft), as well as Zortech C (by Symantec). Many of these versions also provide work with C and C++ (see below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C++ [C++] is a high-level programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrap based on the C language. It is an extended version of it that implements the principles of object-oriented programming. It is used to create complex programs. For IBM PC, the most popular is the Turbo C++ system from Borland (USA).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C# (C Sharp) – “C Sharp”: an object-oriented programming language, the development of which was announced by Microsoft in 2000. By its nature, it resembles the C++ and Java languages and is intended for software developers using the C and C++ languages so that they can create Internet applications more efficiently. It is indicated that C # will be closely integrated with the XML language. For more information, see – [600], as well as on the Microsoft Web site (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://msdn.microsoft.com</a> ).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fortran [FORTRAN - FORmula TRANslation] is a high-level programming language developed by IBM in 1956 to describe algorithms for solving computational problems. It belongs to the category of procedural-oriented languages. The most common versions of this language are Fortran IV, Fortran 77 and Fortran 90. It is used on all classes of computers. Its latest version is also used on computers with parallel architecture .</p>
<p>AppleScript is a machine-dependent (focused on working with Apple Macintosh-type PCs) programming language close to natural English, designed to automate repetitive tasks mainly related to computer graphics processes (including processing scan results, image input, color separation, cataloging, transferring printed documents to the World Wide Web, etc.). It was planned to develop a version of this language for PowerPC. For more information about it, see [198].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clipper is a high-level language and programming system designed for the development of programs for personal computers, mainly systems for managing large amounts of data (see “DBMS&quot;). The owner and developer of the Clipper language and system is the company Nantucket (USA). The beginning of work on their creation is associated with the development of a compiler for dBase (see below) and dates back to 1984 (the year of the founding of the company Nantucket by Barry Rebell and Brian Russell). The first Clipper software products were ClipperWinter’84 (May 1985), ClipperWinter’85 (January 1986), McMax (Macintosh PC version - September 1986) and ClipperSummer’87 (December 1987). In the summer of 1990, a version of the Clipper 5.0 language was released, which became widespread in Russia. It implements the concept of an open architecture and is a language, compiler and software development system for PCs, including a set of commands and functions, a preprocessor, a linker, a set of utilities (including a debugger and embedded documentation) [173].</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>SGML (Standardized General Markup Language) – “Standardized Generalized Markup Language&quot;. The development of the language was caused by the need to create tools for describing documents and rules for their construction. To define the structure of a document, special labels are used – “tags” that separate document elements and Document Type Definition files (DTD) from each other, performing the functions of a “grammar” and defining the structure and content of each element in the document. Adopted by ISO as a standard in the 80s. The complexity of this language prevented it from forming the basis of the first specification for Web – HTML, which became a derivative of SGML [336].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>html, html (HyperText Markup Language) - “Hypertext Markup Language” was developed at the CERN Research Center in 1992. It is derived from SGML (see below). html sets the format of hypermedia documents in the WWW network. HTML documents are ASCII files that can be viewed and edited in any text editor. The difference from a regular text file is the presence in HTML documents of special commands - tags that specify the formatting rules of the document [114, 141, 329, 336]. The full html description can be obtained at the network address: &lt;http://www . access.digex.net/^werbach/barebone.html&gt;</p>
